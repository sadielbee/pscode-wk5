// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers
add the 2 numbers together
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

a / 2 = 0.5a rem0

num1 / 2 = half num1 remainder x
half num1 remainder 0 = even
half num1 remainder =/= 0 = odd
print result

Ask for 1 number
Divide the number by 2
If the number divides by 2 with no remainder, it is even
If the number divides by 2 with a remainder other than 0, it is odd
Print the resulting determination on the screen

// Exercise 3:
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

a + b + c + d + e = sum
sum / 5 = avg

num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum
sum / 5 = avg
print result

Ask for 5 numbers
Add all 5 numbers together
Take the sum of the 5 numbers and divide them by 5.
Print result on the screen.
